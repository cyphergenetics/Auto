Important Notice
================

The mid-2011 dissolution of Xelhua severely decentralized management and
distribution of Auto 3. To mend this, we advise all users thus:

[noxgirl](https://github.com/noxgirl), the original designer of Auto, has
reorganized the Auto Project, which shall henceforth be the maintainer of all
Auto versions, including the legacy 3.x and the new 4.x line.

Therefore, all users of Auto 3 should consider the central upstream to be this
[Auto-legacy](https://github.com/Auto/Auto-legacy) repository.
