Important Notice
================

The mid-2011 dissolution of Xelhua severely decentralized management and
distribution of Auto 3. [mattwb65](https://github.com/mattwb65) assumed leadership
and we commend him for his _bona fide_ continued maintenance of Auto.

To serve the software and the community better, and to produce a new version 4.x,
the Auto Project has been regrouped by [noxgirl](https://github.com/noxgirl),
Auto's original designer.

Henceforth, the legacy 3.x, in addition to the new 4.x, shall be maintained
by the members of the Auto Project.

Therefore, all users of Auto 3 should consider the central upstream to be the
[Auto-legacy](https://github.com/Auto/Auto-legacy) repository.

To reflect this in your clone, run:

    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Auto/Auto-legacy
    git pull origin master
