1. DESCRIPTION

Auto IRC Bot is an IRC channel bot that was created in December of 2009, over
time, it progressed into a bot with an advanced and lightweight module API. Many
of its features are modules and can be loaded/unloaded to your wish.

Using the module API, you can also write your own modules to further extend your
copy.  If you think your module is useful and should be included in the mainline
program, you can contact us and request that your module be added to contributed
modules. There is a chance that it will be accepted.
