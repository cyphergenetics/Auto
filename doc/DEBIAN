It has been brought to our attention that Auto users are frequently
encountering problems with using Auto on Debian. The reason for this is that
Debian repositories distribute an old, incompatible version of File::Path.

Please rectify this on your system by installing the latest from CPAN, with
`cpan -i File::Path`. Thank you.

Affected:
   Debian
   Ubuntu
